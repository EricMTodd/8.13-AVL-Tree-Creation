# 8.13-AVL-Tree-Creation

This week we are going to continue our development of trees and make a balanced AVL tree. The functions you will need are stubbed out in the AVLTree header file. Specifically you need to implement the insert function that will insert a new value and rebalance the tree if neccesary. In order to test for balance you will need to implement the getBalance() function. In order to rebalance it will be neccesary for you to implement both the rotateRight() and rotateLeft() functions. I have implemented some of the functions you created last week. There is a testbench included which will help you to test your code. I have gotten you started with a 10 element tree - you should try out larger numNodes to insure that your code is functioning as intended at higher values of n once you are done developing. Do not edit the function headers. Do not use global variables. Any algorithms that operate on more than one level of the tree should be recursive in nature. This program will take longer than most of the ones you have done so far this semester, get started early.
